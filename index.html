		<h1 style="font-size: 2.25rem; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.1rem;">About me</h1>
		<p>I'm </p><p id="thename" style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Hanu</p><br><br>
		<p>An </p><p style="color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">ISTP</p><p>, I enjoy using my analytical and logical skills to create as a Programmer, while also exploring my creative side as an Artist. Aside from that, I'm also a Music Hoarder and an Eccentric person. I have a strong inclination towards experimentation and practicality, and I often find myself drawn to unique and unconventional approaches. I don't have any role models or idols. Instead, I try to improve from my own experiences, both good and bad.</p><br><br>
		<p>I am majoring in Electrical Engineering after graduating from highschool in 2023. Being a CS Enthusiast, the field of Electricals and Electronics naturally overlap with my interests. Besides these, I am quite fond of creating Art using just a pencil and a ball-point pen. I aspired to become a Terrorist, then an Artist, then a Programmer... and right now I don't have any fixed goal. I just do things that seems to be fun and interesting (I don't want to work), be it creating a new personal about-me site or a mini terrarium (failed terribly). I also started learning </p><p style="color: #00FFF0; font-weight: bold;">Electric Guitar</p><p> after watching </p><p style="color: pink; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">Bocchi and Mio</p><p>, it was too hard to not to after being influenced by them. I like cats, my favorite breed would be the orange. I also like Pygmy Marmosets and often try to find ways for smuggling them for myself (no success so far).</p><br>
		<p>Working out and calisthenics are some other activities in my routine usually to fulfill the lack of physical work everyday.</p><br><br>
		<p>My music taste is pretty inconsistent, I'm never fixed to any particular genre or artist, same goes for my taste in other media. In computer games though, my favourite genre gotta be Fantasy and Open World. Which explains my all time favourite game to be </p><p style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Dark Souls</p><p>, and Skyrim to some extent AND Transcendence.</p><br><br>
		<p>I like Mountains, if my intrusive thoughts someday takes control over me, I'll probab</p><p style="font-weight: bold;">[REDACTED]....</p><br><br>
		<p>Currently trying out different algorithms and visualizing odd things on console. ASCII Art, Image rendering, and Maths. Some future projects would be to embed Hatsune Miku vocalizer into a physical device, a network jammer (to ruin peace of others), and maybe making my own personalized chatbot with a personality of it's own. I also write short stories and article related to my fantasy (?), and what-ifs kinda stuff, which can be accessed through the link to my other site (Archive).</p><br><br>
		<p>Getting in touch with me on discord would be easier compared to email, as I rarely check my inbox. If you share similar interests or would like to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out to me on Discord or other platforms.</p>
